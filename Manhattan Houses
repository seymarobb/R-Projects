'''I have chosen the Manhattan dataset to analyze. First I have read the data using readxl() function. 
Then I have checked the data using summary(), head(), str() functions. 
I have realized that some column names were wrong, so I have changed them. 
Then I have attached the dataset to my global environment.'''
